    "## **Multiple Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-world problems, a single feature is not sufficient to make accurate predictions. **Multiple features** are used when the output depends on more than one input variable. In linear regression, this leads to a model known as **multivariate linear regression**.\n",

    "## **Polynomial Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial regression is an extension of **linear regression** that allows us to model **non-linear relationships** between the input features and the target output. Instead of fitting a straight line, polynomial regression fits a **curved line** to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is still considered a **linear model in terms of parameters**, because gradient descent or the normal equation can be used to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the relationship between the input $x$ and output $y$ is non-linear. A simple linear model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_\\mathbf{w,b}(x) = w_1 x + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "might underfit the data. By introducing **polynomial features**, we can better capture the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_\\mathbf{w,b}(x) = w_1 x + w_2 x^2 + w_3 x^3 + \\dots + w_n x^n + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x^2, x^3, ..., x^n$ are additional features created from the original input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Predicting House Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the price of a house depends non-linearly on its size:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Size (1000 sq.ft) | Price ($1000s) |\n",
    "|------------------|----------------|\n",
    "| 1                | 150            |\n",
    "| 2                | 200            |\n",
    "| 3                | 250            |\n",
    "| 4                | 330            |\n",
    "| 5                | 450            |\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear model might underfit, failing to capture the curvature of the data. By introducing polynomial features (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3$), the model can fit a curve that follows the trend more accurately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(x) = b + w_1 x + w_2 x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Creating Polynomial Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a single feature $x$.  \n",
    "2. Add polynomial terms: $x^2, x^3, ..., x^n$.  \n",
    "3. Treat each new term as a separate feature in the regression model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In practice:**\n",
    "- You can use libraries like **NumPy** or **scikit-learn** to generate polynomial features automatically.  \n",
    "- Feature scaling becomes more important because higher-degree terms can have very large values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can model non-linear relationships while still using linear regression techniques  \n",
    "- Simple to implement using gradient descent or the normal equation  \n",
    "- Flexible by increasing the degree $n$ of the polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cautions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** High-degree polynomials can fit training data very closely but fail to generalize  \n",
    "- **Feature scaling:** Polynomial terms can have very large values; scaling prevents gradient descent from being inefficient  \n",
    "- **Choosing degree:** Too low → underfitting; too high → overfitting. Use cross-validation to select the optimal degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polynomial regression allows linear models to capture non-linear patterns  \n",
    "- Introduces additional features like $x^2, x^3, ..., x^n$  \n",
    "- Still linear in parameters, so gradient descent and normal equation apply  \n",
    "- Feature scaling and careful degree selection are essential for good performance\n",
