## 🌟 Final Note

**The foundation is now set.**

I have dedicated these weeks to building an unbreakable base, ensuring that when I use modern tools, I understand the "why" and "how" behind them. Now, I turn the page from **Learning** to **Building**.

My next step is to enter the arena of **Real-World Projects**—where I will apply this deep understanding to build **advanced, modern AI systems** that solve real problems.
