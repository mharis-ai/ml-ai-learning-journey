## 🧭 Development Standards & Practices

- 💡 All queries are written and executed manually — no auto-generation or GUI query builders.
- 🎯 When needed, ChatGPT is used only for conceptual clarification, not for copying solutions.
- 📌 Commit messages are clear, concise, and reflect actual progress.
- 🔄 Work is updated consistently as part of my scheduled study workflow.

## 🛤️ Roadmap Integration

This course is part of **Phase 02 – DSA, SQL and Data Analysis**:

> 🔸 **The Complete SQL Bootcamp: Go from Zero to Hero**  
As part of my structured 10-phase ML/AI Engineering roadmap, this course focuses on building strong practical SQL querying skills.  
Upon completion, I will proceed to **Data Analysis with Python – (FreeCodeCamp)** within the same phase.
