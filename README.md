# 🛠️ Machine Learning & AI Engineering Journey  
### 🚀 75 Weeks · 10 Phases · From Zero to Production-Ready

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my disciplined, full-time journey to become a **production-ready Machine Learning Engineer** — someone who not only understands AI systems in depth but can build them end to end with clarity, logic, and precision.

The roadmap spans **75 weeks** and is organized into **10 structured phases**, covering:  
**Python Git Foundations**, **Mathematics for Machine Learning**, **Data Analysis, Algorithms and Engineering**, **Classical Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning Foundation**, **Cloud, Testing and ML System Design**, **MLOps and Production Machine Learning**, **Fullstack AI Development and Tools**, **Generative AI and LLM Foundations**, and **Advanced LLM Engineering, Agents, and RAG**.

Every concept here is studied, practiced, and implemented by me — with full effort, deep reasoning, and personal accountability at every step.

> ✳️ I use ChatGPT to support my learning — especially for concept clarification, Markdown structuring, or when I’m genuinely stuck — but every code, solution, and explanation reflects my own understanding and logical effort.

---

## 🔥 Weekly Commitment

- 🗓️ **Daily (Monday–Sunday)**  
- ⏱️ **8 hours/day**  
- 🗃️ **GitHub commits every Wednesday and Saturday**
- 📝 **Weekly LinkedIn Learning Summary – Posted Every Sunday**

This is a consistent, long-term investment — not just to finish a roadmap, but to become a capable ML/AI engineer through depth and repetition.

## 🧠 Principles I Follow

- ✅ One top-rated, industry-approved course per phase — no hopping or overload  
- ✅ All `.py` and `.ipynb` files are written through my own problem-solving — no shortcuts, no code generators.
- ✅ All `.md` files are guided by ChatGPT — but based fully on my own progress and reflections.
- ✅ Handwritten notes (when used, like in Math phases) are my personal derivations  
- ✅ I reason through logic, debug actively, and write my own explanations  
- ✅ ChatGPT is used only as a tutor, never a shortcut  
- ✅ I revisit topics until they click — I don’t move on for the sake of pace  
- ✅ I treat each module as real training, not just curriculum  
- ✅ I push to GitHub on a fixed schedule — with clear structure, clean commits, and updated documentation. 
- ✅ My portfolio is a reflection of real work — not automation

> 💬 *This journey is not about shortcuts — it’s about depth, discipline, and long-term technical skill. I code everything myself, think independently, and push forward every single day with curiosity and intent. The goal is to become a highly capable ML engineer — with the depth to understand algorithms, the discipline to build from scratch, and the skill to develop full AI systems end to end.*
