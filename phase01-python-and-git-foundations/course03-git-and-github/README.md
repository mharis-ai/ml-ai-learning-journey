## 🧭 Development Standards & Practices

- 💡 Manual work — All Git and GitHub tasks are completed personally without shortcuts.
- 🤝 Support use — When challenged, I consult ChatGPT for conceptual guidance, not for copying commands.
- 🔄 Update rhythm — Commits are pushed consistently on **Wednesdays** and **Saturdays**.
- 📌 Clean commits — Commit messages are task-specific, honest, and progress-focused.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git CLI (manual, no GUI)  
- GitHub  
- Markdown for documentation  
- Manual terminal-based version control
