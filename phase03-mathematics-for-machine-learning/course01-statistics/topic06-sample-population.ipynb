    "\n",
    "- A **population** includes **all members of a group** you want to study.  \n",
    "- Represents the **entire dataset**.  \n",
    "- Often too large to study directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- All adults living in a country  \n",
    "- Every student in a school  \n",
    "- All transactions in a company for a year  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Terms Related to Population:**  \n",
    "- **Population Mean (μ)**: Average of the entire population  \n",
    "- **Population Variance (σ²)**: Variance of the entire population  \n",
    "- **Population Standard Deviation (σ)**: SD of the entire population\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **sample** is a **subset of the population**.  \n",
    "- Used to **estimate population parameters** because studying the entire population is often impractical.  \n",

    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- 500 adults surveyed from a country  \n",
    "- 50 students selected randomly from a school  \n",
