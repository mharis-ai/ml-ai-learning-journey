    "# 📊 Hypothesis Testing Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics used to make decisions or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. It allows us to test assumptions, compare groups, and determine whether observed patterns are statistically significant.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "Summarize and describe the main features of a dataset.  \n",
    "Examples: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "Make predictions or decisions about a population based on a sample.  \n",
    "Used for: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. What is Hypothesis Testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic procedure to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample to support a claim about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "- Evaluate assumptions  \n",
    "- Determine statistical significance  \n",
    "- Make data-driven decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Null and Alternative Hypotheses (H₀ and H₁)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, we start by assuming a position (H₀) and then checking if the sample provides enough evidence to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**  \n",
    "- The default assumption  \n",
    "- States **no effect**, **no difference**, or **no relationship**  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - *H₀: The mean weight of apples = 150g*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ / Ha)**\n",
    "- Competing claim we want to test  \n",
    "- States **effect exists**, **difference exists**, or **relationship exists**  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  - *H₁: The mean weight of apples ≠ 150g*\n",

    "## **4. Significance Level (α)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",

    "Typical values:\n",
    "- 0.05 (most common)  \n",
    "- 0.01  \n",
    "- 0.10\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Meaning**\n",
    "> α = 5% ⇒ 5% risk of rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Confidence Interval (CI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter.\n",

    "Example:  \n",
    "If 95% CI = (47.2, 53.8), we say:  \n",
    "> “We are 95% confident that the population mean lies between 47.2 and 53.8.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Relationship with α**\n",
    "> Confidence Level = 1 - alpha\n",
    "- α = 0.05 → 95% CI  \n",
    "- α = 0.01 → 99% CI\n",

    "### **Type I Error (False Positive)**\n",
    "Rejecting H₀ when it is actually true.  \n",
    "Probability = α  \n",
    "Example: Saying a treatment works when it actually doesn’t.\n",

    "Failing to reject H₀ when H₀ is false.  \n",
