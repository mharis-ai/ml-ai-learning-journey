    "# 🎲 Types of Events in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Simple Event**\n",
    "An event that has **only one possible outcome**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Rolling a die and getting **4**.  \n",
    "- Drawing the **Ace of Spades**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Compound Event**\n",
    "An event that includes **two or more possible outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Getting an **even number** when rolling a die → {2, 4, 6}.  \n",
    "- Drawing a **red card** from a deck (26 outcomes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Independent Events**\n",
    "Events where the **occurrence of one does not affect** the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Tossing two coins.  \n",
    "  Getting heads on one coin does not affect the result of the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Dependent Events**\n",
    "Events where the **occurrence of one affects** the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Drawing two cards **without replacement**.  \n",
    "  The first draw changes the probability of the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Mutually Exclusive Events**\n",
    "Events that **cannot occur at the same time**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- Rolling a die: You cannot get **3** and **5** in the same roll.  \n",
    "- Drawing a card: You cannot draw a card that is **both a heart and a spade**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Exhaustive Events**\n",
    "A set of events is exhaustive if **together they include all possible outcomes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "When rolling a die:  \n",
    "- Events {1, 2, 3} and {4, 5, 6} are exhaustive because they cover all six outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Impossible Event**\n",
    "An event that **cannot happen**.  \n",
    "**Example:** Rolling a die and getting **7**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Certain Event**\n",
    "An event that **will always happen**.  \n",
    "**Example:** When tossing a coin, getting **heads or tails**.\n",
