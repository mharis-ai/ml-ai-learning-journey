# 📘 Phase 03 – Mathematics for Machine Learning

This phase develops the **core mathematical foundations** required to understand, implement, and optimize machine learning algorithms. It emphasizes practical intuition, problem-solving, and applied mathematics directly aligned with ML workflows. You will strengthen your capabilities in **statistics**, **probability**, **linear algebra**, and **calculus**, all of which form the theoretical backbone of modern AI systems.

## 🧾 Personal Commitment and Next Steps

| 🔍 Section        | 💬 Details |
|------------------|------------|
| **Integrity** | All notebooks and implementations in this phase are based on course instructor material but have been thoroughly refined by me. I used GPT as a conceptual and explanatory tool to clarify, enhance, and reorganize content in my own style, ensuring that all work reflects my understanding and mastery of the concepts. |
| **Next Phase**    | Upon completing Phase 03, I will progress to **Phase 04 – Classical Machine Learning**, where I will build, analyze, and optimize traditional ML algorithms. This includes applying mathematical foundations from this phase to real-world datasets, implementing models from scratch, and developing strong intuition for algorithmic behavior. |
