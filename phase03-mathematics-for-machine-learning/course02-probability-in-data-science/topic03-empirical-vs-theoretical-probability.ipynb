    "# 📊 Probability: Empirical vs Classical (Theoretical)\n",

    "## **1. Classical (Theoretical) Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on **equally likely outcomes**\n",
    "- Calculated **without experiments**, using logic or reasoning\n",

    "**Formula:**\n",

    "> P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes\n",

    "Tossing a fair coin - Probability of heads:\n",
