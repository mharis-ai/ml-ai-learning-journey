    "# 📊 Bayes’ Theorem in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayes’ Theorem** is one of the most important concepts in probability and statistics.  \n",
    "It allows us to **update prior beliefs** when new information (evidence) becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem connects **marginal**, **joint**, and **conditional** probabilities into one powerful formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. What Is Bayes’ Theorem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes’ Theorem describes the probability of an event **A** given that another event **B** has occurred:\n",
    "\n",
    "> P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P(A)** = Prior probability (initial belief about A)  \n",
    "- **P(B|A)** = Likelihood (probability of B happening if A is true)  \n",
    "- **P(B)** = Total probability of evidence B  \n",
    "- **P(A|B)** = Posterior probability (updated probability after seeing B)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Understanding Each Component**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Prior Probability — P(A)**  \n",
    "Your initial assumption before seeing evidence.  \n",
    "Example: Probability a randomly selected email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Likelihood — P(B|A)**  \n",
    "Probability of observing the evidence B **if event A is true**.  \n",
    "Example: Probability the email contains the word “Free” if it is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Evidence — P(B)**  \n",
    "Overall probability of evidence B occurring (regardless of A).  \n",
    "Example: Probability any email contains “Free”.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **🔹 Posterior Probability — P(A|B)**  \n",
    "Updated probability after incorporating the evidence.  \n",
    "Example: If an email contains “Free”, what is the updated probability that it is spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Expanded Formula (Law of Total Probability)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes P(B) is not directly known, so we compute it as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A')\n",
    "\n",
    "Where **A′** is the complement of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Example of Bayes’ Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "- 20% of emails are spam → **P(A) = 0.20**\n",
    "- 70% of spam emails contain “Free” → **P(B|A) = 0.70**\n",
    "- 10% of non-spam emails contain “Free” → **P(B|A′) = 0.10**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Compute evidence P(B)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> P(B) = (0.70)(0.20) + (0.10)(0.80) = 0.14 + 0.08 = 0.22\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Apply Bayes’ Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "> P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B) = (0.70 × 0.20) / 0.22 = 0.636\n",
    "\n",
    "### **📌 Final Result:**  \n",
    "If an email contains the word *“Free”*, there is a **63.6% probability** it is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Why Bayes’ Theorem is Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used in **machine learning**, **spam detection**, **medical diagnosis**, **NLP**, and **decision systems**\n",
    "- Helps update beliefs using data  \n",
    "- Forms the foundation for **Naive Bayes Classifier**\n",
