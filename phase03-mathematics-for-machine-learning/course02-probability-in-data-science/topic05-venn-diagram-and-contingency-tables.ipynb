    "# 📊 Venn Diagrams and Contingency Tables in Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Venn diagrams and contingency tables are powerful tools used to **visualize relationships** and **organize data** in probability. They help understand events, overlaps, intersections, and conditional probabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **1. Venn Diagrams in Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Venn diagram** is a visual representation of events using circles inside a rectangle (the sample space). It helps illustrate intersections, unions, complements, and mutually exclusive events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Elements:**\n",
    "- **S** = Sample space (the rectangle)\n",
    "- **A, B** = Events (circles)\n",
    "- **A ∩ B** = Intersection (common region)\n",
    "- **A ∪ B** = Union (all outcomes in A or B)\n",
    "- **A′** = Complement (not in A)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Union of Events (A ∪ B):**  \n",
    "   Probability that event A occurs **or** event B occurs  \n",
    "   > P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Intersection of Events (A ∩ B):**  \n",
    "   Probability that **both** events occur  \n",
    "   > P(A ∩ B)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutually Exclusive Events:**  \n",
    "   No overlap between events  \n",
    "   > P(A ∩ B) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Venn Diagrams Are Useful:**\n",
    "- Visualize overlapping probabilities  \n",
    "- Understand relationships between multiple events  \n",
    "- Useful in solving probability and set theory problems\n",

    "## **2. Contingency Tables in Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **contingency table** (or **two-way table**) organizes data to show the frequency distribution of two categorical variables. It helps compute **joint**, **marginal**, and **conditional** probabilities.\n",

    "### **Types of Probabilities from Contingency Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Marginal Probability**  \n",
    "   Probability of a single event  \n",
    "   > P(A) = (a + b) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Joint Probability**  \n",
    "   Probability of two events occurring together  \n",
    "   > P(A ∩ B) = a / n\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional Probability**  \n",
    "   Given one event occurred, probability the other occurs  \n",
    "   > P(A | B) = a / (a + c)\n",

    "| Type | Visual (graphical) | Tabular (numerical) |\n",
    "| Best For | Showing overlaps and relationships | Calculating probabilities from data |\n",
    "| Shows | Union, intersection, complement | Marginal, joint, conditional probabilities |\n",

    "## **4. Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Venn Diagrams** help visualize relationships between events, especially unions and intersections.  \n",
    "- **Contingency Tables** organize data into rows and columns to compute marginal, joint, and conditional probabilities.  \n",
    "- Both tools simplify the understanding of probability rules and help solve problems clearly and efficiently.\n",
