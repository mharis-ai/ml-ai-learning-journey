# Chapter 1 — Introduction

---

This chapter introduces the core idea of programming: telling the computer what to do by writing step-by-step instructions. It explores why programming matters — for solving real-world problems, automating repetitive tasks, and developing systems that think logically.

For me, this chapter marks the official start of my Machine Learning and AI journey using Python. It includes setting up the environment and writing my first working script.

### Exercise 1.1 — Hello World (First Program)

**Task**  
Write a Python program that prints a simple custom message.

**My code**

print("hello world, This is my first program towards my ML/AI journey stay tuned: github/mharis-ai")

**What it does**  
This line prints a custom message to the screen. It’s a simple check to ensure Python is properly installed and working — and that I can write, save, and run basic scripts on my own system.

## Reflections

This may seem like a small step, but it's a meaningful one. Setting up the environment and writing a working program is where all real learning begins. From this point forward, each chapter will build on this foundation — and every commit will reflect deliberate progress in my AI/ML engineering journey.
