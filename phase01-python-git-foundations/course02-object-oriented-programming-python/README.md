# 📘 Object Oriented Programming in Python – Chai aur Code (YouTube)

Hands-on implementation of **OOP in Python** by Chai aur Code as part of **Phase 01 – Python and Git Foundations**. Covers classes, objects, constructors, methods, properties, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and multiple inheritance.

Each topic is manually implemented and version-controlled using Git. Exercises are written from scratch, named consistently, and organized into cleanly structured folders. All updates are pushed twice a week to maintain a disciplined professional workflow.

## 🧭 Development Standards & Practices

- 💡 Manual coding — All solutions are written from scratch without auto-generation.
- 🤝 Support use — When challenged, I consult ChatGPT for *how* to implement logic, while independently exploring *why* it works.
- 🧠 Logic-first approach — I strive to build solutions through reasoning and practice before seeking external help.
- 🧪 Consistent naming — Each `.py` file is named descriptively to reflect its topic.
- 📁 Organized structure — Folders and files are arranged clearly for easy navigation.
- ✍️ Documentation — Each file begins with a concise comment explaining its purpose.
- 🔄 Update rhythm — Commits are pushed consistently on **Wednesdays** and **Saturdays**.
- 📌 Clean commits — Commit messages are task-specific, honest, and progress-focused.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3.13  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Git CLI (manual, no GUI)  
- GitHub  
- Markdown for documentation  
- Manual terminal-based version control

## 🛤️ Roadmap Integration

This course is part of **Phase01 – Python and Git Foundations**:

> 🔸 **Course 02 – Object Oriented Programming in Python – Chai aur Code (Youtube)**  
As part of my structured 10-phase ML/AI Engineering roadmap, this course focuses on strengthening programming fundamentals through Object-Oriented Programming in Python. Upon completion, I will proceed to the **Git and GitHub** course to continue Phase 01.
