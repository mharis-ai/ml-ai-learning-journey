# 📘 Phase 1 – Python Git Foundations

This phase lays the groundwork for my ML and AI journey by focusing on two essential skills: Python programming and Git-based version control. It includes structured coding practice, clean documentation, and consistent versioning across two core courses.

## 🧾 Personal Commitment & Next Steps

| 🔍 Section        | 💬 Details |
|------------------|------------|
| **Integrity**     | All code is manually written by me without using auto-solvers or AI-generated answers. I only use ChatGPT for conceptual guidance, documentation refinement, and structuring help — never for copying solutions. I strive to build logic independently and seek help only when genuinely stuck. |
| **Next Phase**    | After completing Phase 1, I will move to **Phase 2 – Math for Machine Learning**, focusing on the core mathematical foundations behind ML, including linear algebra, calculus, and probability. |
